title: "A Workflow I Can Reuse"

I tend to value workflows that are easy to structure, repeat and don’t require much setup.

This project follows a simple loop: write in Markdown, preview locally, and deploy through GitHub Pages.  
Each step is predictable, which helps keep the focus on content and structure instead of configuration.

I like having a workflow I can repeat rather than changing steps for small projects.
