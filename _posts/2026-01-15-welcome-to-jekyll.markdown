title: "Structure Without a Framework"

This project doesn’t use a front-end framework, but it still relies on the same structural ideas.

Layouts define shared structure, and individual pages supply only what’s unique.  
The result is less duplication and a clearer separation between layout and content.

It’s a reminder that good structure isn’t tied to a specific tool.
