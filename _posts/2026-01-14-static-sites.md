I used a static site workflow for this project because it keeps the focus on structure rather than tooling.

With Jekyll, content lives in Markdown and pages are assembled at build time.  
There’s no runtime logic to manage, which makes the site easier to reason about and maintain.

For content-driven projects, this tradeoff feels appropriate.
